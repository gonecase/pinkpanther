					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Dead Ant is an iconically terrible joke from the 90s. Geddit? Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>What are we doing here, exactly? Trying our damnedest to track the most exciting space right now in pop culture, without using the words edgy or alternative (it’s harder than you think). </p>
<p>Standup comedy is here and its time is now, and we believe its potential for impact is massive. So we’re going to do everything we can to keep you up to date on what’s up—news, reviews and interviews; big fish and the small fry; your favourite comedians RN and who you’re going to be obsessed with next, and where you can watch them live.</p>
<p>We’re here to chronicle the changing landscape of comedy in India, and engage and grow the community. We’re that really fun virtual water-cooler that fans and comics have been waiting to hang out at. So come hang out already!</p>
<p>Headquartered in Mumbai, India, we also want an office in Tokyo one day so double tap the donate button accordingly? Gee, thanks. </p>

						<h3>Maaz Ahmad Siddiqui</h3>
						<h4>Social Media Strategy • Writer</h4>
						<br>
						<p>Maaz is our writer and social media strategist who struggles to say strategist without making a face. He has an unhealthy obsession with puns and pop cultural references, but while that’s impossible to bear on a daily basis, it’s good for business. Based in Mumbai, Maaz is a colossal disappointment to his parents, who really wanted him to be a doctor (he has a BSc in Zoology). Instead, the quiet rebel joined comedy collective EIC, where he was Senior Social Media Executive. And now we here.</p>

						<h3>MIhika Jindal</h3>

						<p>Ravish Rawal is our app developer. When he’s not falling off ski lifts in Vermont, he works as a Mechanical Engineer designing smart home infrastructure in New York City. He also enjoys programming, and building digital platforms and apps. The Dead Ant app is ‘Coming Soon’ because it’s still winter in that part of the world, and gloves are inconvenient for coding.</p>
